# SHepub


Trying to make scribblehub stories into epubs since 1/08/2020!

If you want to run it on your own machine please clone this repo and do
```
python -m venv shepubenv && source shepubenv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can also run it in a google collab at https://colab.research.google.com/gist/S10MC2015/20bf4058c318008979c983bfb9073710/shepub.ipynb
