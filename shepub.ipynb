            "The trainee disciples cheered, happy to finally be finished with the training.\n",
            " \n",
            "After being around Rin for approximately two weeks, they already stopped being completely terrified of her. While she was still cold and scary, they weren’t worried about her killing them for something as simple as cheering. The only thing they worried about now was her beating them up whenever they weren’t listening or replied with an idiotic response.\n",
            " \n",
            "“I’ll be send you into Hell Difficulty, now.” Rin stated blandly before glaring toward the group of trainees. “If you have any questions or regrets, now the time to mention them.”\n",
            " \n",
            "In the silence, Kara spoke up. “It is fine if you don’t wish to go into Hell Difficulty.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin sent a menacing glaring at her sister, who responded with a similar glare. After have a non-verbal argument, Rin reluctantly agreed. “Hell Difficulty is dangerous and even with this course, there’s a high likelihood of death. Now is the time if you want to be cowardly… Once you have entered, you’ll no longer than choice.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“What do you believe our chances of survival are?” Inquired a woman in an analytical tone.\n",
            " \n",
            "All the trainees in the group immediately began to pay attention. This was a question they wanted to ask, but hadn’t dared.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin silently calculated their chances of survival.\n",
            " \n",
            "Presuming the group had been paying attention to her advice and made the correct decisions, with their current physique and combat skills…\n",
            " \n",
            "“Less than 10 percent.” Rin calmly replied.\n",
            " \n",
            "Although Rin didn’t know their abilities, they hadn’t used them in the sparring. She could only assume they were non-combat related.\n",
            " \n",
            "The biggest problem was the many powerful monsters in the wild area. If any of them were unlucky, once something dangerous caught their scent, their chance of survival plummeted dramatically.\n",
            " \n",
            "The group of trainees gasped and glanced around at one another. While they might’ve known that they could be in that statistic, it’s human nature to believe that the unlucky people are going to be somebody else.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Any other questions.” Rin calmly asked.\n",
            " \n",
            "None of the trainees spoke. Any other questions had already been answered in the past two weeks and they couldn’t think of any others of the top of their heads.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin waited thirty seconds before moving onward. “Anyone who wish to leave, do so now.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Nobody spoke.\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara and Rin watched the group and the twelve people each looked at one another.\n",
            " \n",
            "None of them choose to leave. Each had their own personal reasons for being here, but it was a combination of peer pressure and desire for power that kept them in place.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Line up.” Rin ordered preparing to transport them into Hell Difficulty.\n",
            " \n",
            "The twelve of them stepped into a single file line and Rin approached the person at the front.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Remember to move immediately upon teleportation.” Rin reminded whilst interacting with the system. She ordered it to swap the difficulty level of the person in front to her.\n",
            " \n",
            "The man vanished in a light of teleportation a moment later.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Next.” Rin indicated for the next person to step forward. Everyone stepped forward one at a time and vanished into Hell Difficulty’s tutorial.\n",
            " \n",
            "As the last person vanished, Kara spoke to her sister. “Are you sure this was a good idea?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“We’ll find out.” Rin stared into the empty room, “If any of them show up again, have them train another group to travel into Hell Difficulty.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara stepped next to her sister, “Is that a good idea?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“If they’ve managed to survive that long, they can handle it.” Rin turned away and began walking out of the room.\n",
            " \n",
            "Following Rin out of the room, Kara twirled around her sister. “You’re planning on leaving now, right?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“There are some minor things to take care of first.” Rin nodded as they walked.\n",
            " \n",
            "“What about Toby?” Kara quizzically inquired, leaning forward into Rin’s line of vision.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin momentarily paused stopping, leaving Kara to continue walking in front of her. When Kara realized she waited for her catch up. “Hmm?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Nothing, Tobias will be fine on his own.” Rin continued walking forward and brushed off the question.\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara momentarily frowned, but didn’t bring up her protest of the decision. She had already expressed her disapproval previously, there was little point in doing it again. “Alright.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Sorry, I simply don’t have time to stick around. Keep yourself safe.” Rin apologized, “Before the year ends, we need to finished with the Third Zone of Hell Difficulty.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Why do you need complete these zones anyway?” Kara complained, “I know some people do it for the power by artifacts, others for the wealth they can provide… but, you don’t need the power from the artifacts. If it’s wealth, I’m doing well enough for the both of us.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“You don’t know?” Rin blinked at looked at her sister in surprise. “Where do you think the people inhabiting this place went?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Inhabiting this place? You mean the natives?” Replied Kara, unsure where she was going with this topic. “There are some here and there in the Residential Zone.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“A corrosive change in the surrounding mana caused them to be almost wiped out.” Rin informed her and continued to explain. “The new mana is corrosive slowly destroying all matter and affects living organisms more easily. The reason we’re fine is the process a faction in the universe created that tutorial had us undergo a process to adapt to it beforehand.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Okay? So, what? We’re fine?” Kara shrugged, she didn’t particularly care about the reason they were teleported here or why they were fine. Life had improved. She’d awakened her superpower and created a guild. Rin had found someone she liked and become more powerful.\n",
            " \n",
            "Before this, they were in a situation where they barely had the capital to survive day to day. If hunting went badly, they could get unlucky while traveling, or encountered powerful mages that wanted meat and refused to pay. They could easily go hungry for several days.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin shook her head, “The rest of the universe didn’t mysteriously disappear because of the change. There are other factions with deity-levels that want to dispose of us because we can adapt to the new mana.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“People of that level wouldn’t lower themselves to dealing with mortals.” Kara easily dismissed her worries.\n",
            " \n",
            "When a mage reached Deity-level in their old universe their power-level underwent a massive change. Their bodies constantly generated enough mana to continuously cast spells without having to worry about mana. Even their basic spells gained far more power and their lifespan became infinite.\n",
            " \n",
            "Before reaching Deity-level, mages needs to stay inside a largely populated city to regenerate mana and it took a long time to increase their mana otherwise. While their bodies produced mana, it was a rate that it was barely noticeable.\n",
            " \n",
            "As for the specific process on how to reach deity-level, they had no way of having contact with that knowledge. Nor was it particularly relevant to them.\n",
            " \n",
            "Those with bloodline of superpowers had another path to become a deity-level which involved expanding the authority of their powers. Superpowers were passed down through bloodline making it easy for them to reach the level of their predecessors, but harder to grow beyond it.\n",
            " \n",
            "It was far more difficult for superpower bloodlines to grow stronger when compared with mages. Mages relied on intelligence, personal talent, and knowledge.\n",
            " \n",
            "In comparison, superpower required none of that.\n",
            " \n",
            "Even an idiot could become almost unbeatable with a powerful bloodline. They only had to awaken to their bloodline’s power.\n",
            " \n",
            "Regardless of the specific mechanisms of bloodlines and magic, whether any of them became deity-level, they tended to stop caring about the affairs of mortals. Catching the attention of someone at that level is almost impossible.\n",
            " \n",
            "A mortal’s lifespan was simply too short in comparison. Wait around for a hundred years, they’ll all be dead.\n",
            " \n",
            "“This universe has different rules.” Rin shook her head, “Their deity-levels don’t have unlimited lifespan.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“They simply haven’t reached the deity-level, it’s a qualitative state. Not something that can be easily reached by simply becoming powerful.” Kara waved her hand in dismissal.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin informed her. “Regardless, people here reached the power-level of a deity. Even if they failed to accomplish the last step and they want to destroy us. The protection system preventing their factions invasion arrival isn’t perfect.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Protection system?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“I don’t know the details. Tobias would-” Pausing mid-sentence, Rin shook her head. “Never mind any details.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“How does that relate to completing the zones?” Kara inquired.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Like an abandoned house with nobody managing and repairing it, the protection system will quickly expose flaws that they can utilize and won’t last forever.” Rin explained as they walked out of the guild hall.\n",
            " \n",
            "It was early morning, the street was relatively empty.\n",
            " \n",
            "“You mean the current peace won’t last long?” Kara quickly understood her meaning.\n",
            " \n",
            "Acknowledging that her sister had been correct, Rin spoke metaphorically. “Precisely, we’re inside a surrounded city and the food supply is slowly depleting.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“In other words, you’re doing going forward for power?” Inquired Kara, “Trying to turn the battle around? Or simply give us the capital to escape?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Does it matter?” Rin glanced at her sister with a strange gaze. She was being awfully pushy for some reason. While forcefulness wasn’t extremely out of character for Kara, it was still strange she’d chosen this topic.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Suppose not.” Sighed Kara, before her expression returned to normal playfulness. “Makes more sense why you bothered to train a group people, though.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin informed, “Wasn’t my idea.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Oh~ it was Toby’s idea?” Kara jumped on the new topic, her expression brightened and a small smile appeared on her face.\n",
            " \n",
            "Not dignifying the question with a response, Rin continued walking forward.\n",
            " \n",
            "“A self-sustaining cycle to increase our overall strength. A decent idea.” Kara noted before frowning, “Assuming they survive the process.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Personally, I don’t see the point.” Rin quietly replied. “Although Hell Difficulty needs more people, I don’t think recruiting in this manner is the way to go about it. Selecting a massive group and throwing them in without training would result in better warriors.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“That would result in massive losses. You already stated that yourself.” Kara frowned.\n",
            " \n",
            "“It would also result in only the elites with powerful abilities surviving. Hell Difficulty doesn’t need weak people to make up the numbers.” Rin reminded. “There are a person in Hell Difficulty that cannot be killed, and that an impressive feat that cannot happen with simple training.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Nobody would agree to join without training.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin’s eyes flashed in a cold light, “They would if the alternative was certain death.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara glared at her sister. “Stop treating other people’s lives like they don’t matter. This isn’t the same world we were in before. There isn’t a function civilization to make up numerous losses. You need should realize that.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“There are people outside of this little bubble.” Reminded Rin, “Even if everyone here died, civilization could still exist.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Even so, deity-levels do not treat the common people’s lives as worthless and slaughter them on mass. Civilization would’ve been wiped out had they done that.” Kara argued. “Keeping your current views will cause innumerable damage to society when you grow to that level.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara never once doubted that her sister would eventual grow to deity-level. Her sister had been an unimaginably talent figure in her eyes. Their dad had praised her constantly for her fighting talent.\n",

The appearance of a top-level bloodline would shake the entire foundation of the political landscape. An ethnic group without a top-level bloodline individual and one containing an individual with a top-level bloodline were two completely different concepts.\n",

            " \n",

            " \n",
            "While I probably looked weird taking my bag to a formal dinner, I didn’t particularly care. I’ll put it under the table when I get there. I’m not letting my stuff out of my sight. That’s how things get stolen.\n",
            " \n",

            " \n",
            "Opened the door revealing a decently sized dinning area. It seems we avoiding the embarrassment of being late, as the princess wasn’t here yet. There were only a few maids inside.\n",
            " \n",
            "After talking with the maids, Stanley indicated where I should sit down. A maid left the room after showing us to our seats.\n",

            "Placing my bag underneath the table, I psyched myself up for meeting this ‘princess’.\n",
            " \n",
            "To be honest, in my opinion, sticking far away from any nobles and royalty is the best idea. Meeting with nobility of any kind… well, I’ll just say I’m biased against them.\n",
            " \n",
            "The whole idea of a cute princess in desperate needing of saving from a hero and getting married to the rescuer is simply naïve. They're more likely to brush you off, or give you a sum of money to display their appreciation. If you come across a situation where they want to marry their princess to you in real life, there’s a strong possibility you are been cheated or they are getting far more to benefit from the marriage than they are letting on.\n",
            " \n",
            "The other two possibilities are that it is a new noble family without much experience or a noble family declining to the point of collapse. If a noble family is marrying their daughters out for little benefit to the family, their current situation is not far from utter collapse.\n",
            " \n",
            "Marrying them to some random savior is simply unthinkable. The benefit of such a transaction would have to far larger than normal to even consider having their daughter marry outside of nobility.\n",
            " \n",
            "There’s a reason why millionaires don’t donate large portions of their money to random charities and don’t randomly give millions to their friends. Anyone with money, who doesn’t spend their time attempting to make more money, won’t stay wealthy for very long… and everyone always wants a piece of pie and nobody is trustworthy.\n",

If she actually got kidnapped, then the situation would become a million times worse.\n",

            " \n",
            "I already have a basic understanding of the layout of this zone of Hell Difficulty. I was merely trying to refresh my memory and see if they had any detailed information. Attracting a world full of trouble for a simply map and getting a naïve princess killed? Not worth it.\n",
            " \n",
            "Surprised that Stanley even considered it. There’s no way that idea would end well.\n",

            "“I seem to remember that immediately afterward I saved you and your girlfriend’s lives from heat stroke.” The princess snorted out another small azure-colored fire. “If anything, you’re the one who was lucky I was there.”\n",

            "Stanley already had the death of the twins and the many other people who died due to his careless reactivation of the map setting.

            "Turning around, the princess pushed open the door and left the dinning room. When out of view the princess several tears could be seen dripping down her cheeks. Despite keeping face in front of her guest, Stanley’s rejection had clearly a hurt her.\n",

            " \n",
            "“I already know I’m not a hero.” Stanley responded with sadness and quietly mumbled. “Heroes can actually save people.”\n",

            "Tobias stood up and shrugged preparing to leave the room. Before stepping through the exit, in an extremely serious voice, Tobias stated. “Heroes only exist in novels.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Chuckling at the thought and relaxing, Stanley tried to drag his mind away from sadness and joked back. “Don’t forget TV, anime, and comics.”\n",
            " \n",
            "True heroes as seen in those fictional mediums couldn’t exist in real life. People always acted with selfish motivations and other motivates. That didn’t make people inherently bad, or did anything to change a good deed.\n",
            " \n",
            "A good deed was a good deed… but it did make them something other than a true hero.\n",

            "Gromit, the dull-grey dragon, had arrived in the solar system and descended upon the planet. Still completely furious at having been given this task, and more than willing to harm others to display his rage. In his mind, the fault lay partially on these half-breeds for relaying information that caused this humiliation. Their continued existence was a sin.\n",
            " \n",
            "Meanwhile Rin had arrived in the Third Zone. She planned to search out the remaining relics in the extremely limited amount of time left… but the teleportation array random destination had caused her arrival to land near the volcano where the Draconian’s lived. Whether that outcome was lucky or unlucky, only time would tell…\n",
            " \n",
            "Unlike the others in Hell Difficulty who seemingly had been fooling around in other places, Hansoo had been training and utilizing his knowledge to keep growing more powerful. He had since picked up his pace of collecting the various relics needed to deal with the monster guarding the teleportation beacon’s exit. It hadn’t taken him long to realize that the others weren’t collection their portion of the relics, which had forcing him to speed up his pace.\n",
            " \n",
            "As a result, Hansoo had been traveling through the burning fields to the west to collect the necessary result to melt the ice immortal before sealing him... and the dragon’s appearance in the solar system was immediately noticed by him.\n",
            " \n",
            "The dragon hadn’t exactly been hiding its mana signature and was extremely arrogant. Thinking that nothing on this world could possibly hurt him, which was partially correct… had Hansoo not been collecting artifacts specifically to kill an immortal beforehand.\n",
            " \n",
            "While Hansoo noticed the dragon’s arrival, he didn’t particularly care about arrogant dragon’s arrival. The artifacts he’d been collecting were one time-usage. Hansoo definitely wouldn’t waste on them on an opponent if it wasn’t necessary.\n",
            " \n",
            "Firstly, Hansoo thought that the dragon had been there in his previously life and disappeared without causing a problem. Meaning that nobody noticed its existence.\n",
            " \n",
            "Secondly, if the dragon chose to harm anyone from the intelligent races without provocation, the system’s countermeasures would activate. The Redeemers had effectively changed goal of the system provide a relatively safe area for the trial takers to grow up. Having them slaughtered by an opponent far above their level violated that goal.\n",
            " \n",
            "Any monster who violated the treaty and attack them would be retaliated against.\n",
            " \n",
            "The countermeasures might not kill a being at the dragon’s level, but they would definitely teach the arrogant monster a lesson that it wouldn’t forget. Of course, that wouldn’t help the person who was killed… but it was enough of a deterrent to prevent random slaughter as long as it wasn’t provoked.\n",
            " \n",
            "Thus, Hansoo only became alert because of the dragon’s presence... he had a deep understanding of dragons and their power level.\n",
            " \n",
            "This was an elder dragon, which were only sent out on extremely rare occasions. Even though Hansoo thought it was impossible, his usage of their time artifact to travel back in time might’ve somehow been noticed upon inspection and attracted their attention.\n",
            " \n",
            "At this point in time, an elder dragon would be extremely difficult to deal with. Relying on artifacts made it possible to deal with the elder dragon, but that was only a small possibility and effectively ruined their chances of them leaving this zone.\n",
            " \n",
            "When the dragon descended toward a random volcano in the distance, Hansoo was relieved.\n",

            "Nearby the volcano, Rin frowned upon seeing the dragon’s presence descending from the sky toward the volcano near her location and moved to hide her presence. The power-level of the dragon was approaching deity-level, while it hadn’t quite reached it… the dragon wasn’t a monster she could deal with.\n",

            " \n",
            "At the same time, I realized that I didn’t need to rely solely on the plant to absorb away the mana from the barrier. I could also try myself. While a grown up world tree would definitely absorb far more than I ever could, it wasn’t grown up yet.\n",

            " \n",
            "The girl in a white dress clearly hadn’t noticed my existence until I spoke and jumped in fright from suddenly noticing me, spilling her drink on herself. She looked like a frightened deer in headlights, frozen in fear staring in my direction.\n",
            " \n",
            "Sighing, I apologized. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.”\n",

            "People are usually unable to notice me until I speak to them. Although this girl slightly abnormal for jump-scared by my appearance, the military woman was more abnormal for noticing me.\n",
            " \n",
            "“No- it’s…” The girl grabbed a nearby cloth and tried to clean up her dress, still stumbled but less scared by my sudden appearance, “It doesn’t matter, do you need something?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Ah, sorry to bother you. I was just wondering if you had a healing ability?” I asked with slight hope.\n",

            " \n",
            "My source might be wrong, or the healer might’ve already left. She might also just be unwilling to reveal her ability to a stranger. Regardless of what it is, I should talk to the barkeep and military woman before leaving. That would reveal the accuracy of my sources information at the very least.\n",

            " \n",

            "I gazed toward her with surprise. “You have a healing ability?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Ironic, isn’t it.” The military woman laughed, stole the drink that had been placed on the bar in front of me and drank it. I had no idea why it was ironic from her point of view, but wasn’t in a position to question her.\n",
            " \n",
            "“I need your help.” I explained.\n",
            " \n",
            "“No, thanks.” The military woman shrugged. “What did you expect? Did you honestly think a random stranger will help you just because you asked?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“In approximately six months, I plan on entering into a special competition and require someone with a healing ability to join me.” I stated plainly. “You will be fairly compensated for your time and will save someone’s life.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Do you know? I discovered something interesting about abilities.” The military woman swirled the liquid around in the glass, “It certainly doesn’t apply to everyone, but it applies to enough people that I find it interesting. People’s abilities tend to be inversely related to their desires.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“What?” I stared at her in confusion.\n",
            " \n",
            "Firstly, I didn’t understand what this had to do with anything. We were having bargaining about whether or not she would help me. Having a random conversation about abilities is completely irrelevant.\n",
            " \n",
            "Secondly, I knew abilities were randomly developed by people’s bodies. That’s what I’d written in the novel. The idea that they were based around people’s desires was absurd.\n",
            " \n",
            "For example, Rin’s ability was inborn from their bloodline. The process to adapt to foreign mana merely awakened her inborn superpower.\n",
            " \n",
            "Despite internally dismissing her theory, the military woman lifted the glass upward. She didn’t seem to care about my opinion, thus I didn’t understand why she was even bothering to explain this theory to me.\n",
            " \n",
            "“For example, someone that wants to protect people is more likely to get an offensive ability and vise versa.” The military woman turned her eyes toward me and stared. With an intent that stated the example she was providing was deliberate, “Someone that wants to be famous might get a stealth ability.”\n",
            " \n",
            "I retorted. “The whole theory is absurd. At the very least, I don’t want to be famous it has too many disadvantages.”\n",
            " \n",
            "It was an interesting theory, but it wasn’t based on any sort of factual basis. Her argument in it of itself was flawed.\n",

            "I’ve never wanted to be famous. Only ever wanted to be… actually, nevermind, it doesn’t matter.\n",
            " \n",
            "“As I stated, it doesn’t apply to everyone and it’s not an exact science.” The woman shrugged seemingly not caring that I’d dismissed her theory, “But it certainly an interesting theory. At the very least, I know several people it applies to… including myself.”\n",
            " \n",
            "I finally realized the entire point of this conversation, and her divergence from my request. “You’re saying you want people to get hurt or die? That’s why you got a healing ability.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Your words not mine.” The military woman shrugged and took another sip from the glass of alcohol.\n",
            " \n",
            "“No, didn’t you save your friends back in Hard Difficulty?” I interrupted her with a solid argument. Despite knowing it would expose that I studied up on her beforehand. It didn’t matter if she knew I explored her background information.\n",
            " \n",
            "After all, the likelihood of someone showing up in this bar looking for a healing ability the day she’d arrived was already low enough that it basically confirmed I was searching for her beforehand.\n",

            "“Sometimes living is crueler for than dying… and, as you stated, they are my friends. It’d be inconvenient if they died.” The military woman simply explained with a smile, she didn’t seem perturbed by my knowledge of her background. “None of those conditions seems to fit in your case. I won’t be helping you.”\n",

            "“Yep.” The military woman casually responded.\n",

            " \n",
            "If I opened up with an offer, I’d either drastically overestimate or underestimate her ideal price. I’d rather her name her price first, then begin negotiations from there.\n",

            " \n",
            "“Yeah, that’s not possible.” I laughed at her idea of a joke. Even if I wanted to, I wouldn’t be able to kill Rin and I had no desire to. “Name an actual price.”\n",
            " \n",
            "The military woman replied whilst stretching out her arms, “Life for a life. I don’t see the problem.”\n",

            "I narrowed my eyes toward the military woman. It appears I misjudged her. She’s completely insane.\n",
            " \n",
            "“That’s is literally impossible. My girlfriends a prophet, she’s the very reason I know I need your help.” I calmly stated, “It would literally be impossible for me to kill her. If I ever decided to implement the idea, she would know immediately and react accordingly.”\n",
            " \n",
            "While this isn’t an entirely accurate description of Rin’s ability, it should be enough to dispel her suspicion.\n",

            "“You mean to say Kara is your girlfriend?” The military woman raised an eyebrow, clearly doubting my statement.\n",
            " \n",
            "I suppose Kara’s name would be the first person people think of when they think of a prophet. She is the head of a guild and famous for her prophecy.\n",
            " \n",
            "“No, someone else.” I rolled my eyes at the thought. “I’m not a pervert. Kara’s only like… 11 to 12 years old?”\n",
            " \n",
            "Then again, Rin’s body is only like… 14 or 15 years old? So it's probably not much better at this point. Don’t blame me. She’s far older mentally speaking!\n",
            " \n",
            "“So, who is this girlfriend of yours?” Asked the military woman.\n",
            " \n",
            "“That’s none of you business.” I didn’t plan on answering that question. Having Rin put in danger because of this woman’s idiocy is a bad idea.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Anyway, I’ve told you my price.” The military woman shrugged. “If you want my help, killing your girlfriend is all you have to do.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“I see… you never had any intention of negotiating from the start.” I nodded as we walked down the street.\n",
            " \n",
            "“You’re only figuring that out now?” The military woman chuckled.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Good bye, then.” Releasing a breath of air to keep myself calm, I stormed off and left her alone.\n",
            " \n",
            "I will not give her the satisfaction of getting angry in front of her.\n",
            " \n",
            "Approximately six months, I have approximately six months to figure out a way to either get another healer’s help or creating an artifact that can heal people.\n",
            " \n",
            "If I truly cannot solve the problem, I can try kidnapping Violet by petrifying her.\n",
            " \n",
            "I’d need Violet to prove she can actually heal people before kidnapping her. That’s easy enough, though. I can simply ask for proof of her ability before I decide whether to complete her task.\n",
            " \n",
            "Returning back to my shop, I shut the door behind me. Soon as that was done, my eyes turned cold and anger boiled up within me. As my eyes stared at the far wall in the room, it began to turn to stone.\n",
            " \n",
            "The petrified stone crawled outward from that spot on inanimate wall. Realizing I would accidentally cause serious damage the shop if this continued, I forcing my eyes shut.\n",
            " \n",
            "Even if Violet had no idea who Rin was, she still tried to cause her death. Whilst I’d gotten better at controlling my petrifying gaze, to the extent I usually didn’t think about it, this level of anger is more difficult to control.\n",
            " \n",
            "If not for my distaste of harming people and the help I needed healing Kara, I might lost control earlier and petrified her immediately.\n",
            " \n",
            "I would’ve done something I’d regret had I stuck around.\n",
            " \n",
            "Breathing deeply, I tried to calm myself with closed eyes.\n",
            " \n",
            "Someone who desires people to be hurt or killed… That’s who Violet is. I can recognize that now.\n",
            " \n",
            "Violet told me beforehand, yet I hadn’t believed it.\n",
            " \n",
            "Someone who desires suffering and pain. Whether that pain is from other emotional or physical distress. If that weren't true, she never would’ve proposed the condition of killing my girlfriend in light of helping me.\n",
            " \n",
            "In all likelihood, even if I did as she asked, Violet would've only enjoy seeing the suffering and pain on my face. Then refused to help me anyway to watch the distress of pain of betrayal.\n",
            " \n",
            "Someone like that receiving a healing ability…\n",
            " \n",
            "She was right. It truly is ironic.\n",

            " \n",
            "“It doesn’t matter. Both of you can do this if you want.” Damien rolled his eyes and waved away her concerned, placing two fist-sized ores on the desk.\n",

            " \n",

            " \n",

            " \n",
            "“Mithril… It’s impure and the amount is too small to make anything, though.” Tobias examined the ore, before calmly stating. “To be usable, it would have to be alloyed. That decreases its value further.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“What you are going to do with the metal has nothing to do with us. You could simply save it until you acquire more, it shouldn’t decrease the price.” Laura negotiated from behind her sister.\n",
            " \n",
            "Tobias stared between the two girls and the mithril ore, before sighing. “Fine, I’ll eat the loss. It’s a usable material. Pick one of the smaller artifacts from the box.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Lina poked her head in the box on the counter. “This looks pretty~”\n",
            " \n",
            "She pulled out a bracelet with various decorative patterns atop it. The bracelet easily fit around her wrist.\n",

            "“Ah… no, that-” Tobias stood up noticing the bracelet Lina had taken out of the box and reached toward her, “-that isn’t for sale.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Avoiding Tobias reach, Lina backed up keeping the bracelet around her arm.\n",
            " \n",
            "Laura frowned at his attitude, “It’s definitely one of the smaller items. Are you going back on your word?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“It’s a prototype.” Tobias explained with an apologetic expression, “A teleportation bracelet. I forgot I put it in there.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“It’s pretty, I’ll take it.” Lina smiled, glanced at it around her wrist. “How does it work?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Injecting mana with a destination within 20-30 meters in mind should work, but it’s untested and-” Tobias began to explain the dangers only to be caught off-guard by the girl teleporting across the room.\n",
            " \n",
            "“This is so cool~” Lina turned back toward her sister after teleporting, “Definitely having this.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“-extremely dangerous...” Tobias’ voice branched off into a whisper and he swallowed his saliva. “Right. You can keep it.”\n",
            " \n",
            "A suspicious expression appeared on Laura’s face. While she hadn't heard his whisper, she had doubts as the craftsman had been completely against selling it a moment ago.\n",
            " \n",
            "“It’s not working, now?” Lina stated with disappointment.\n",
            " \n",
            "“The bracelet won’t work in rapid succession, but it should recharge after a period of time…” Tobias explained with a slightly worried expression as he looked at the girl.\n",
            " \n",
            "“How long would that take?” Laura asked, looking at the bracelet on her sister’s wrist.\n",
            " \n",
            "“It’s an untested prototype, I had no idea it would even work.” Tobias explained while glancing at her sister, “A day, maybe longer? Maybe a lot longer.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“That’s disappointing.” Lina expression fell, before lightening back up. “It’s still really cool though! Short-distance teleportation~”\n",
            " \n",
            "“It’s a prototype. I planned on giving it away for free in return for collecting data about it.” Tobias explained. “If you’re willing to regularly report about the performance, you can choose another.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Laura narrowed her eyes upon hearing that information, but didn’t refute. Giving away a useful artifact for free meant it was dangerous for general usage or that he wanted to use it to get closer to them.\n",
            " \n",
            "Whatever the case, keeping in contact with him was a good idea.\n",
            " \n",
            "If the artifact was dangerous, keeping in contact with the craftsman meant they could learn about any life-threatening problems with artifact in advance and potentially solve them.\n",
            " \n",
            "If the craftsman merely wants to close the relationship between them, Laura had even less of a reason to refuse. Potentially leveraging a talented person over to their guild wasn’t something she would easily refuse. Their guild wasn’t in a position to be picky with their methods of acquisition.\n",
            " \n",
            "“What does this one do?” Lina rummaged through the box once again and pulled out a small necklace with a yin-yang symbol engraved on it.\n",
            " \n",
            "“A rechargeable barrier.” Tobias noted, “Upon activation, it’ll block a single attack below a certain strength level and weaken attacks above that amount by a margin. Limited to once per hour or so.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Neat.” Lina placed it around her neck. “I’ll choose this then.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Now that we’ve concluded that transaction, let’s negotiate for this piece.” Laura placed the other piece of mithril on the table.\n",
            " \n",
            "Tobias looked like he’d eaten a fly.\n",
            " \n",
            "“What naivety? What childlike innocence?” Tobias muttered to himself in annoyance. “Stanley, you’re full of crap.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Silence spread throughout the room for several seconds.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Who’s Stanley?” Laura barely managed to catch a few words of his mumblings and was extremely confused.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Doesn’t matter, just an old friend of mine who has forgotten all about me.” Tobias waved off her question with melancholy.\n",
            " \n",
            "“I’m sure you’re wrong~” Lina interrupted him with a joyful smile, “Friends don’t forget each other.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“If only I had your unwavering confidence.” Tobias didn’t dismiss her fantasy and merely shook his head. “Just take another small artifact from the pile, next time you’re paying full price.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Thank you~” Laura stepped up the box and perused through the artifact, far more carefully than her sister.\n",
            " \n",
            "After asking several questions about different artifacts, Laura frowned. “These are all defense or auxiliary artifacts.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“I don’t sell weapons.” Tobias snorted.\n",
            " \n",
            "“You mean you won’t sell us weapons.” Laura corrected his statement with a displeased expression.\n",
            " \n",
            "“I don’t sell weapons to anyone.” Tobias placed the second mithril ore back on the table. “Even if I did sell them, it’s irrelevant. What you’ve provided is nowhere close to enough to trade for it.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Fine.” Laura understood that weapons tended to take far more materials than the small trinkets they were taking and decided not to argue, despite the discrimination against her guild. “Anything providing night vision?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Night vision?” Tobias glanced at her with a doubtful gaze, “I can only duplicate an effect I’ve seen before. Unless you have an artifact on hand with night vision, that isn’t happening.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Laura fell into contemplation and asked. “I can borrow one. How long would it take you to make?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Depends on how complicated engraving it is. A week or two maximum.” Tobias furrowed his brow as he thought over the project.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Customizable?” Laura asked.\n",
            " \n",
            "Tobias shrugged, “Depending on the situation.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Fine, I’ll leave the ore as deposit.” Laura nodded in agreement.\n",
            " \n",
            "Laura couldn’t do anything with the ore, anyway. Keeping it or returning it to the guild was pointless and would probably anger the guild leader. Better to leave it with him to increase goodwill. It was already stingy of her to negotiate a personalized artifact instead of taking one that was premade.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Happy cooperation.” Tobias shook hands with the twin and placed the mithril ore behind the counter.\n",
            " \n",
            "As Laura was preparing to leave, the realization occurred to her that she didn’t even know the craftsman’s name. “What’s your name, again?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Tobias, it was nice to meet you.” Tobias greeted them with a proper introduction before, remembering that he hadn’t asked their names. “Your names were?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Lina~” The girl waved with the teleportation bracelet on her hand.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Laura.” The other twin replied as they prepared to leave the building behind.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Ah! Wait.” Tobias remembered something as the two were leaving, “If you come across something called a Decima game token, I’m willing to trade a high price for it.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Kay~” Lina joyful replied with a wave, while Laura didn’t reply she had noted his name in her mind.\n",

            "An endless marsh ran in all directions for miles, there was little to nothing in the surrounding miles except the soggy wetland that was the normal terrain of the Fourth Zone. Within that terrain, a squad of ten people with heavy shields and polearms traveled atop of the landscape and each wore the guild crest of King’s Prophet.\n",

            " \n",
            "Griffins are strange creatures, they were an incomprehensible mix between two beasts that claims to be kings of their domain. Taking the general body shape from the kings of the savannah, the fierce and courageous lions; along with the head, front claws, and wings of the proclaimed kings of the sky, the sharp and clever eagles. Their claws could slice metal in twain and beaks that easily pierce the flesh.\n",

            "Truly, griffins were terrifying and dangerous creatures.\n",
            " \n",
            "The squadron from King’s Prophet was nothing to scoff at either. The fact they have advanced to the Fourth Zone of Hard Difficulty and have the confidence to venture forth to battle clearly indicated the power and teamwork of the squadron and despite the challenging terrain and heavy load, the squad is advancing with a relative normal speed toward a landmass in the distance that was unencumbered by soaking wetness of the rest of the marshes.\n",
            " \n",
            "On that landmass, the griffin was foretold to reside. Regardless of the potential fierceness and deadly battle ahead, the squad could be said that have unwavering confidence. They had a prophet on their side directing their actions and strategies in battle, if they weren’t inclined to win this combat, they could only blame their own incompetence.\n",
            " \n",
            "They had only arrived at this landmass after many hours of travel through the marsh. Thus, the entire group was already in a completely exhausted position when the squadron finally reached semi-dry land.\n",

            "If the squadron had a singular advantage in this fight against the griffin, it was the element of surprise. The squad was prepared and ready for the upcoming battle, while the griffin had no way of knowing they were here.\n",
            " \n",
            "It takes a thousand days to guard against a thief, yet only a single opportunity is enough for a successful theft. Attacking will always be easier than defending as the attacker has the ability to choose when and where to attack. When defending, you have to prevent defend everywhere at once otherwise someone can easily take advantage of a weak spot.\n",
            " \n",
            "After preparing the ranged armaments, the squadron rapidly changed location to a more hidden area and rested in preparation for the upcoming fight. Their unnecessary supplies for the upcoming fight were hidden and stored and their battle gear was prepared.\n",
            " \n",
            "The battle preparations were complete, the group approached the center of the island and saw the nest of the griffin. The griffin rested atop a ten-meter circle that resembled a bird’s nest. The griffin itself could only be compared to a larger horse in terms of size.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Shield formation, pikeman ready for ambush. No further verbal communication until combat.” Kara swiftly ordered.\n",
            " \n",
            "With the griffin asleep in its nest, Kara had swiftly decided this was the time to ambush it. Waiting would only serve to provide the creature warning to their existence and provided no guarantee about a better opportunity.\n",
            " \n",
            "Half the squad moved to the front with heavy duty shields. The others quickly ready their respective polearms and advanced behind them. The group slowly approached the griffin.\n",

            "Their attempt to ambush the creature seemed destined to fail. Upon reaching the nest, their heavy armaments and protective clothing preventing them from approaching silent. The branches of the bird-like nest crumpled under their weight and their armor clattered causing the griffin to awaken.\n",
            " \n",
            "The newly awakened griffin screeched upon noticing the intruders and its seven-meter wingspan spread out across the nest. The griffin’s eagle-like beak released a sharp warning for the intruders and the griffin’s wings flapped raised its body into the air.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Pikeman!” Kara swiftly ordered the attack and the pikeman swiftly responded, charging forward and attempting to strike the beast.\n",
            " \n",
            "The majority of the attacks barely damaged the griffin, whose size prevented the beast from avoiding the sudden attacks. Their attacks drew blood, but only a single attack fortified with an ice ability managed to causing anything above a minor injury to the beast.\n",
            " \n",
            "Shrieking in pain and anger, the griffin flapped its wings and released a gust of air in the direction of the pikeman knocking the majority of them over. The shield-bearers rushed forward and covered the pikeman, as the griffin lifted into the air.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Stonewall defense.” Kara ordered, while firing her own rifle toward the griffin’s head. The bullets fired and lodge themselves in the body of the griffin, only serving to anger the creature further.\n",
            " \n",
            "Diving down from the air toward the squad, the griffin crashed into the shield bearers who had used magic to reinforce their own defense capabilities. Despite the magical assistance, the griffin plowed through the squadron knocking most of them over and causing serious injuries with its claws to several of them. The pikeman reconvened and attempted to damage the creature, but were out of position completely unable to stop its charge.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Reposition!” Kara ordered the group to get back in formation while firing the rifle several more times toward the griffin to attract its attention.\n",
            " \n",
            "With the constant barrage of firepower from Kara, the griffin focused its attention on her. Flying and diving into a charge in her direction, Kara immediately used several defensive artifacts and blocked its upcoming charge.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Prepare firearms!” Kara dodged as the griffin attempted to maul her.\n",
            " \n",
            "As she bought time, everyone still able to move and maneuver prepared their ranged weapons to strike the monster.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rolling an out of the cone of fire, Kara gave the order to shoot the griffin. “Fire!”\n",
            " \n",
            "A round of gunshots landed on the griffin angering it further. Turning back toward the remaining squadron, the griffin used its wings to release a powerful gust of wind toward squadron. Fortunately, the griffin had followed Kara far enough away that the wind had little effect.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Continuous fire.” Kara ordered before shooting repeating at the griffin.\n",
            " \n",
            "A repetitive barrage of gunshots landed on the griffin with blood dripping out of its chest the griffin screeched and took flight.\n",
            " \n",
            "Instead of sticking around, the griffin swiftly took the opportunity to gain height.\n",
            " \n",
            "The griffin wasn’t going to wait around to be continuously bombarded by the group, it had given up on the nest and decided to escape. No living creature is going to sit around and wait for death.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Release targeted fire spells!” Kara gritted her teeth. Although she was reluctant to do so due to the extreme waste of mana, letting the griffin escape was unacceptable and she knew this was necessary. If it managed to escape, the griffin would definitely wait until they were unprepared and ambush them. At that point, even if they managed to kill it the losses would be unacceptable.\n",
            " \n",
            "The squadron quickly assembled into a formation and combined mana into a powerful formation causing the griffin to be engulfed in flames.\n",
            " \n",
            "Releasing a screech as the flames burned its feathers and body, the griffin disappeared in the flames.\n",
            " \n",
            "After burning for several seconds, the griffin shot out of the other side of the flames with major feather loss and continued flying toward the distance. The creature’s pace albeit far slower than before.\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara’s eyes flashed with anger and she shouted. “Again!”\n",
            " \n",
            "Before they got chance to act, the flames transformed midair into a phoenix. The transformation caused the flame's temperature to grow stronger by several degrees and the surrounding air simmered and sizzled.\n",
            " \n",
            "The flaming phoenix stretched out its wings and flew straight into the air toward the griffin midair at rapid speed. Claws intersected midair, screeches of pain and the midair tussle ended with the griffin falling to the ground.\n",
            " \n",
            "As the griffin crashed into the ground, presumably dead, the phoenix dissipated midair.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Who?” Kara questioningly gazed about the surroundings. None of the people in their group had such a powerful ability. she couldn’t find anyone else nearby.\n",
            " \n",
            "Someone had interfered with their fight.\n",
            " \n",
            "That wasn’t something that could be easily done with mana, it had to have been an ability. Judging by the result, someone controlled and solidified their flames.\n",
            " \n",
            "“You there. Take care of the injured.” Kara calmed down and gave out orders. “Everyone else, we need to confirm its death.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Got it!” The person instructed to remain behind nodded and moved over to their injured comrades. While everyone else prepared to follow after Kara toward the fallen griffin.\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara swiftly arrived at the location of the griffin’s fall and confirmed the griffin had been killed. Its body was covered in burns and many feathers were missing. Additionally, the injuries from their battle and claw marks from the combat with the phoenix midair remained.\n",
            " \n",
            "Staring at the griffin’s burned corpse, Kara recognized the scene. This griffin’s body was the exact scene she had foreseen long before the combat began with her ability.\n",
            " \n",
            "Several people approached the body and reported back. “It’s definitely dead.”\n",
            " \n",
            "A red-clothed woman called out nearby. “You’re welcome.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Pyra.” Kara recognized the woman.\n",
            " \n",
            "Pyracepheus remained the guild leader of the Phoenix guild, one of the larger guilds with many talented ability users. In fact, she could basically only be called the spiritual leader of the guild. All the grunt work of managing the guild was done by others, Pyracepheus was rarely seen within the guild and mostly traveled alone.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Thank you for the help, but it really wasn’t required.” Kara immediately bowed toward her.\n",
            " \n",
            "“It seemed plenty required from my perspective.” Pyracepheus shrugged and walked over to the group. “When did you arrive in the Fourth Zone? This was an ill-prepared attempt to combat this griffin.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“We had the situation under control.” Kara gritted her teeth. Although she’d only arrived in the Fourth Zone of Hard Difficulty a week ago and hadn’t completely adapted to the marsh environment, admitting that would be akin to admitting weakness. She had an image to uphold and failing would reflect badly on her guild.\n",
            " \n",
            "“You were already prepared for the revenge by griffin’s mate, then?” Pyracepheus inquired with a curious gaze.\n",
            " \n",
            "Narrowed her eyes in surprise, Kara had not even been aware the griffin had a mate. She couldn’t exactly say that, though. “I appreciate your concern, but we weren’t planning on stick around that long.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Okay, well… I’ll be taking this.” Pyracepheus approached the griffin and sliced off a single claw. Before waving as she walked away. “Good luck.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara watched silently as Pyracepheus took the claw and traveled out of view. While Kara had said the help was unnecessary, it certainly had made life far easier. If anything the amount Pyra took in comparison to her contribution was too little.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Loot the corpse. Quickly.” Kara ordered, stared about the surroundings.\n",
            " \n",
            "The warning about the griffin’s mate certainly hadn’t fallen on deaf ears. Even if it was just a possibility, it meant Kara didn’t want to stick around longer than necessary.\n",
            " \n",
            "While the squad began disassembling the corpse for useful materials, Kara began walking back over to the griffin’s nest toward the group of injured squad members.\n",
            " \n",
            "“The beast is dead.” Kara immediately asked for a report on the situation. “How are the injuries?”\n",
            " \n",
            "The three injured guild members indicated they were fine with relieved expressions. Kara didn’t pay them any heed, though, and focused her gaze on the healthy guild member taking care of their injuries.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Severe enough to limit their movement for several days, but everyone should live. We’ll need to wait for them to heal before heading back into the marsh, though.” The guild member that had been left behind to tend to the wounded accurately reported.\n",
            " \n",
            "“We might not have a choice on that. Try to get them prepared for movement.” Kara frowned as she thought about Pyracepheus’ warning.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Understood.” The guild member replied despite sounding unconfident in that prospect.\n",
            " \n",
            "Leaving the group behind, Kara entered the griffin’s nest and began looking around. It only took a short amount of time to find a treasure chest. Opening the treasure chest, Kara received a system message about the contents.\n",
            " \n",
            "< Amulet of Concentration – Improves concentration of bearer >\n",
            " \n",

            " \n",
            "Kara stared at the contents with a briefly furrowed brow, picked them up and stored them away. She was unsatisfied with the contents. While the two artifacts given were useful… they weren’t particularly outstanding. The difficulty of fighting the griffin was not unbearably high, but it’s mobility and special characteristics made it a dangerous enemy.\n",
            " \n",
            "Compared to the danger, the rewards received were… lackluster.\n",
            " \n",
            "Griffins were creatures said to guard priceless artifacts and/or treasures. These artifacts, as far as Kara was concerned, were not priceless treasures. They were relatively valuable at most.\n",
            " \n",
            "…Staring at her injured guild members, Kara fell deep into thought and decided to utilize her ability to foresee the coming events. She needed to learn about the griffin’s mate to prepare for combat with it. Hopefully she would foresee when she encounters the monster and begin preparing from there.\n",
            " \n",
            "Activating her ability to create a fate with the griffin’s mate in mind, a scene quickly flashed into her head.\n",
            " \n",
            "A griffin midflight, diving toward a man before turning to stone, crashing into the floor, and crumbling to dust. The man turned to face the her viewpoint for the vision, cold ruthless golden eyes stared at her.\n",
            " \n",
            "Pain drilled through Kara’s head, the vision swiftly ended. Kara leaned on the floor, coughing up blood. If someone looked closely at the blood she’d coughed up, small particles of stone could be seen from within.\n",
            " \n",
            "Feeling nauseated and generally terrible, Kara forced herself to her feet and thought back on the vision.\n",
            " \n",
            "This was the first time Kara had been injured in recoil of any kind from her ability, and the more importantly she’d never seen or heard anything about such a powerful ability. He’d turned a griffin to stone with seemingly no effort.\n",
            " \n",
            "Coughing up more blood onto her hand, Kara wiped it away and quickly called out to the squad. “We’re leaving in an hour, get them prepared. We cannot stick around here.”\n",
            " \n",
            "She had recognized the surroundings as the griffin nests. Thus, they needed to leave immediately.\n",
            " \n",
            "Regardless of who the man was and what he was doing here, Kara didn’t want to be around when he got here. Kara immediately decided to be more careful when she utilized her ability. Fortunately, she had been in a safe location without an immediate threat around her. She hadn’t even been aware it could recoil against her.\n",
            " \n",
            "At the very least, the griffin’s mate would be solved by that man. They only needed to avoid it until that point.\n",

Another measure to ensure those in power stay in power… I snorted and ignore them.

            " \n",
            "Soon, we approached a wooden building that was roughly built. Judging by the lack of buildings in the surroundings and the shoddy construction… it’s safe to say it was constructed by them after arriving.\n",

            "With a nod, I followed her into the building. The interior was pleasantly warm, and comfortable. The building was only a medium size, but contained various necessary and supplies lain about. It was far better living environment than the tents seen as they’d been walking.\n",
            " \n",
            "“What are you doing here? Get out!” Unfriendly eyes turned to us and questioned our existence. There were at least ten people in the building and each was as unfriendly as the last.\n",

            " \n",
            "Unlike the residential zone, it’s rare to find someone you’re unfamiliar with. There simply isn’t that many people on the frontier and every powerful person need to be paid close attention to.\n",
            " \n",
            "“I’m Tobias.” I stated calmly ignoring the obvious hostility in their eyes. “I have a message for your guild leader.”\n",

            "Jody even had the idea of stepping in front to protect me from his murderous intent. I don’t know whether to laugh or cry. His murderous intent is basically no different than a kitten in my eyes. The passive murderous intent Gromrit tended to emit was greater than that.\n",
            " \n",
            "Strength-wise, maybe this guy could hurt me if he threw everything he had at me… but even that damage would only be on the level of a scratch.\n",

            " \n",

            " \n",

            "Along the way to the center I found the stripped down remained of what… might be a griffin. Honestly, it’s only a pile of meat and bones and I’m no expert on anatomy of griffins. It’s certainly large enough to be a griffin, though.\n",

            "Kara and her guild members avoided the griffin’s mate by moving to another area to rest. To prevent any further aggravation of their injuries, the group planned on letting their injured recover before returning to the base camp.\n",
            " \n",
            "Meanwhile Tobias set up camp near the griffin’s nest and was preparing to journey back to the base camp the next day. The various tracking skills that Tobias had learned were practically useless for finding Kara in these wet marshes. No visible trails were left while traveling through the murky water.\n",
            " \n",
            "Back at the base camp, however… the situation was not as calm.\n",
            " \n",
            "The guild leader of Demon Slayers, Damien Stayr, inquired about the situation from Jody. Only to learn from her that Tobias was already gone… more importantly, Tobias had set off into the marshes on his own.\n",

            "When Damien heard from Jody that Tobias had been entered the frontier of the Hard Difficulty zone, he’d allowed her to accommodate any reasonable requests from Tobias due to his forging ability. However, in his mind, reasonable requests mainly included forging material and various crafting necessities.\n",
            " \n",
            "Traveling out into the marshes alone was committing suicide. It wasn’t a reasonable request. Anyone sane simply wouldn’t have allowed a noncombatant to do that.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Tobias said he would be fine.” Jody interjected with an embarrassed expression.\n",
            " \n",

            "“Well-”\n",
            " \n",
            "“No excuses… Organize a search party.” Damien interrupted her, he couldn’t stand the random excuses people gave for their idiotic actions. “Find him! Hopefully before he gets himself killed. Even if he wanted to go out into the marshes, you should’ve taken a group to escort him…”\n",
            " \n",
            "Although Jody disapproved of his scolding of her actions, she merely nodded without further complaint. “Okay.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Am I the only sane person in this guild?” Damien muttered to himself as he walked away.\n",
            " \n",
            "Sadly, while Jody previously had no trouble finding Kara and her associates with her guild’s help, finding Tobias was not as easy. Tobias’ unnoticed ability automatically obstructed their usual tracking methods. Jody could only helplessly travel toward the location she’d sent him, while feeling extremely guilty and regretful. The failure of tracking through their abilities usually meant that the target was dead.\n",
            " \n",
            "Under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t even send a search party if tracking failed. Jody only held a small amount of hope due to Tobias mentioning he had a stealth-type ability and that she had sent him to a specific location. Although finding someone in the marshes without a predefined location was effectively impossible... with a location, it was theoretically possible.\n",
            " \n",
            "At sunrise the next day, Tobias began the return trip through the marshes from the mini-island that housed the griffins. Mere hours after he left, Jody and her search team arrived on the mini-island.\n",
            " \n",
            "It could be said that Tobias was quite unlucky.\n",
            " \n",
            "Had Tobias waited and met the team, their ability to track people would’ve led him straight to Kara and her group. That would’ve saved the time and effort of returning to the base camp. Instead Tobias had returned to the base camp empty-handed without anything to show for his trip beside muddy, soaking wet clothes.\n",
            " \n",
            "As Jody had been forced out into the wilderness along with the people responsible for tracking, it was impossible for Tobias to launch another expedition attempt into the marshes to search for Kara upon returning to the base.\n",
            " \n",
            "Thus, Tobias spent the next few days simply waiting around in the base camp.\n",
            " \n",
            "This delay allowed Kara and her team to recover, which gave Kara precious time to recover from the internal injury that resulted from spying on Tobias.\n",
            " \n",
            "It could be called a cascade of bad luck… or if someone was more dramatic, it could be called the hindrance of fate.\n",
            " \n",
            "In Tobias’ previous timeline, Kara had only created the fate of her death several days before entering the Decima game.\n",
            " \n",
            "However… whether through a series of coincidences or the arrangement of fate, Tobias’ appearance at the griffin’s nest piqued Kara’s interest in the treasures that she’d received there.\n",
            " \n",
            "As the other two treasures were relatively normal, Kara’s attention had been narrowed down onto the Decima game token with its vague description. As her curiosity rose about what had attracted such a strong person to that location and Kara utilized her ability to create a fate to gain more information about the token.\n",
            " \n",
            "This could be called a significant misunderstanding.\n",
            " \n",
            "After getting injured last time, Kara didn’t dare to utilize her ability to search for information about Tobias directly. Thus, to obtain information, Kara started from the objects the man was likely searching for at that location.\n",
            " \n",
            "…and such a situation caused the creation of fate to play out in a similar manner to last time.\n",

            "Preordaining her own future fatal injuries.\n",
            " \n",
            "Normally, Kara was more careful... seeing a few key moments before canceling her ability.\n",
            " \n",
            "However... upon seeing Rin’s appearance in the fate, Kara couldn’t bring herself to end the fate early and tried to obtain as much information as possible. \n",
            " \n",
            "Indirectly, by trying to prevent the creation of this fate, Tobias had created its existence.\n",
            " \n",
            "Not that he knew that… Tobias had taken to waiting inside the King’s Prophet building for their return.\n",
            " \n",
            "When everyone in Kara’s group had recovered enough to make the trip back to base. Kara returned to their guild building with the ten people and the various loot acquired.\n",
            " \n",
            "Upon noticing her return, Tobias spoke up. “Kara? A word please.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Huh? When did you get back in here scum?!” A man from before noticed his existence upon hearing him speak.\n",
            " \n",
            "Another shouted from the crowd, “Demon slayer trash! Didn’t we tell you to get out-”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Quiet!” Kara immediately recognized Tobias from her earlier fate and knew exactly how dangerous he was.\n",
            " \n",
            "The crowd that had been getting louder and louder fell into silence. Before turning toward their guild leader in confusion.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Everyone go out.” Kara waved toward the door, “I need to speak with him alone.”\n",
            " \n",
            "After Kara had watched Tobias destroy the griffin’s mate instantly, before injuring her with a mere gaze, Kara knew exactly how powerful he was. How could she allow her guild to continue angering him? What if he decided to simply kill them all?\n",
            " \n",
            "“Thank you.” Tobias breathed a sigh of relief as he watched the crowd disperse.\n",
            " \n",
            "Waited for her guild members to leave before Kara said, “Why are you here?”\n",
            " \n",
            "The most important question in Kara’s mind was why a powerhouse had invaded their guild territory and wanted to specifically talk with her. Most likely he wanted the Decima game token, but Kara simply couldn’t give it up at this point.\n",
            " \n",
            "Now that a fate had been created with it, Kara needed the token for more information.  \n",
            " \n",
            "“Okay…” Tobias opened his mouth before shutting it, breathing deeply and beginning his rambling. “I’m here to warn you… Sorry- I’m not sure how much I should tell you… about- well, everything.”\n",
            " \n",
            "In silence, Kara narrowed her eyes.\n",
            " \n",
            "This discussion wasn’t going the way she thought it would. Why would he care about saving or warning her?\n",
            " \n",
            "“Uhh- Right, I’ll get to the point.” Tobias interpreted her silence as a request to get to the point, “If you’re not careful your ability will kill you. I’m forgetting the exact timeline, but in approximately three months the Decima game will open and using your ability will put you in a life-threatening position.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Without changing her expression, Kara listened to his explanation and internally scolded him for being slightly too late with delivering his message.\n",
            " \n",
            "“So… if you could just- not do that.” Tobias stated before concluding, “… my life would get a whole lot easier.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara silently assessed and evaluated the situation, trying to figure out how exactly he knew this information. Foresight didn’t make any sense as she’d seen his ability to petrify creatures. Could people have more than one ability?\n",
            " \n",
            "Meanwhile, Tobias was lost because Kara’s expression hadn’t changed in the slightest throughout this entire conversion. He’d just told her she might die, and she hadn’t reacted in the slightest.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Unless you’ve already seen that fate?” Tobias randomly guessed, trying to probe her.\n",
            " \n",
            "His attempt to probe for information failed of course, Kara’s expression gave zero information. Her focus was on her internal thoughts.\n",
            " \n",
            "The fate that Kara had foreseen in advance, along with his warning, meant that Kara knew this deadly danger far in advance compared to last time. That only barely reduced the difficulty of avoiding it, though.\n",
            " \n",
            "After completely failing to get a reaction out of her, Tobias complained to himself, “You two are too bloody similar.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Hearing his mutter, Kara caught onto this piece of information. “Who am I similar to?”\n",
            " \n",
            "Tobias froze and internally regretted that he’d apparently muttered that aloud instead of silently. Contemplating the pros and cons, Tobias decided the highest chance of convincing Kara of the upcoming dangers was to be honest with her.\n",
            " \n",
            "Due to poker face, Tobias misunderstood and had no clue that Kara already took the warning seriously and thought she was merely contemplating whether to believe him.\n",
            " \n",
            "Tobias barely managed to speak out, “Rin. Your sister.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara’s expression brightened upon hearing the news of her sister.\n",
            " \n",
            "Before seeing Rin in the fate, Kara had thought she come to strange universe alone. Kara’s ability had been completely unable to find Rin before interacting with the Decima game token.\n",
            " \n",
            "While Kara didn’t know the exact limitations of her ability, she only knew related objects and information lowered those limitations. Any sort of information about Rin was extremely good news.\n",
            " \n",
            "“You’ve seen Rin? Where is she?” Kara quickly spoke and stepped toward him for information. Compared to her potential death, this news was far more important to her. Kara’s ability to create a fate already provided enough information about her potential death, the only new information from Tobias was the time period.\n",
            " \n",
            "“Where else would she be? I imagine you’ve checked everywhere else at this point.” Tobias rolled his eyes.\n",
            " \n",
            "Thinking about the man’s strength and connection to Rin, Kara immediately arrived at a conclusion. “Hell Difficulty.”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Ding, ding.” Tobias’ expression loosened, and he shrugged, “You’re right. No extra points for that, though.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Understanding the key points, Kara immediately bombarded him with questions, “How is she? What’s your relationship to her? Can you take me to her?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Uhh-” Tobias found his brain stalling from the question barrage. “Rin’s fine, but I don’t know where she is currently.”\n",
            " \n",
            "Kara calmed down and backed away from him, “Thank you for the warning.”\n",
            " \n",

            " \n",
            "This advantage wasn’t perfect as those with higher-tiered bloodlines found it infinitely difficult to awaken their superpower to begin with and couldn’t use mana. Often times, unless those descendants awakened their superpower, they found themselves worse off than regular people.\n",

            "It could be said that if Rin or Kara hadn’t been teleported to this universe and undergone the Redeemer’s process, they would’ve likely never awakened their powers.

            " \n",
            "However that also meant Rin needed to have an extremely strong understanding of the laws of time to upgrade her tier. Due to the unique nature of time and space, the laws related to them are considered one of the most difficult to comprehend and utilize.\n",

            "The infrequency of bloodline improvement stems not only from the difficulty of awakening their bloodline and comprehending any relevant laws. Upgrading a bloodline’s tier wasn’t free of danger. A dangerous trial existed that preventing those who wished to advance tiers.\n",

            "In fact, compared to superpowered bloodline, mages and warriors had far easier time reaching a higher-level.

            "That is to say, if Rin dared to be as blatant and whimsical in turning back time in her universe as she did here, a line of unhappy deities would have shown up at her doorstep. Even if they didn’t kill her, they would’ve stopped the blatant abuse of her ability.\n",
            " \n",
            "Not that Rin was aware of this. How could she know the affairs of deity-level being? While her father had drilled knowledge of many topics into her that certainly didn’t apply to those hidden masters in the deity-level.\n",
            " \n",
            "Fortunately or unfortunately for Rin, this universe had taken a more technical approach to magic. Instead of studying and comprehending the laws of the universe, they relied on formulas and principles of mana to explore the universe and create technological marvels.\n",
            " \n",
            "That isn’t to say this universe is weaker than her homeworld, it simply took completely different path and specializes in different fields. This universe’s knowledge and information related to the laws of time are far weaker due to have little interaction with that field.\n",
            " \n",
            "Before the existence of the corrupted mana and destruction of the majority of the system’s functions, Rin would’ve actually been discovered and tracked down due to her constant usage of the ability.\n",

            "If the two universes actually fought a war when the intelligent races were at their peak, the winner would’ve been this universe with relatively certainly. The unity provided by the system and desire for survival in the early days of this universe’s existence resulted system where the intelligent races banded together very tightly. Even if that unity had been damaged to a lack of foreign enemies, the remaining system would have been propped back up in a time of war.\n",

            "Of course, this is all under the hypothetical that the two universes went under an all out war. There was little need for such a battle in the first place. It was extremely difficult for the two universes to remotely interact with one another, nevermind fighting an all-out war.\n",
            " \n",
            "Regardless, the result the decline of this universe meant that Rin can blatantly abuse her ability with little consequence. This universe no longer has the infrastructure to find the specific cause of time-anomalies, even if it still retains pockets that with the ability to detect and avoid them.\n",
            " \n",
            "Not that any of that matters to Rin.\n",
            " \n",

            " \n",
            "However, if her superpower grew stronger, then Rin had a chance of remedying both problems. The recovery ability of spiritual artifacts in this universe is better than her previous one. Rin has long since prepared the requisite artifacts for recovery afterward. As long as she is successful, Rin can recover from the tribulation and attempt to save them.\n",
            " \n",
            "The warrior path is completely unacceptable to her as it means being unable to save either of them. While Rin is confident in reaching deity-level due to her superpower, there was little point as it wouldn’t help save either of them.\n",

            "Only the laws of time can help in this matter.\n",
            " \n",

            " \n",
            "Failure only means the strength to succeed hasn’t been obtained yet. While Rin firmly believed this, ideals are beautiful and reality is cruel.\n",
            " \n",
            "The law of time and space are not considered the most difficult laws to comprehend for nothing. Even with her ability to jump outside the web of time and observe how a scene will play out a million times from different perspectives, time is an elusive and enigmatic field to study.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin also needs to jump directly from comprehending the laws of time of the seven-tier without any of the feedback from previous tiers. In other words, there’s no way for her to verify whether her understanding of time is correct.\n",
            " \n",
            "In a sense, such a feat is nigh-impossible. Without any way of verifying whether her understanding is correct, the idea of correctly comprehending the laws of time up to the seven-tier, without a mentor or teacher… tough to the extreme is a simply way of putting it.\n",
            " \n",
            "The time it would take is unimaginable. Like a mountain, the further someone goes on the path the more difficult it becomes.\n",

            " \n",

            " \n",
            "While Rin aged normally under these circumstances, her age reverted when utilizing her save/load making her effectively immortal. Continuing on this route, there was steady progress and no risk of failure due to a soul attack. She would eventually complete her task.\n",
            " \n",
            "If Tobias heard of Rin’s plan, he would call it stupid to the extreme. There is no cleverness to it. There’s no thinking involved.\n",

            "Simply put, Rin’s plan is to increase her strength to a level that the universe caves to her demands.\n",
            " \n",
            "Who knows how many years, how many millennial that would take? Understanding the laws of the universe, specifically the law of time is too difficult. Even with fortuitous encounters and enlightenment, it’s impossible for a normal person to reach that height in their lifetime.\n",
            " \n",
            "There couldn’t possibly be a stupider plan in existence. It’s simply brute forcing your way through the problem when it could clearly be solved through other means. Tobias had proved in his previous timeline that Kara could be saved through other means.\n",
            " \n",
            "There’s a reason that Rin’s bloodline limit is the sixth-tier, it’s because advancing beyond that level is almost impossible in a person’s lifetime even for a peerless genius.\n",

            " \n",
            "Specifically, Tobias had vanished after Rin had abandoned him as a partner causing her to feel responsible. While Rin only wanted his safety by distancing the two of them, he disappeared in a way she couldn’t reverse.\n",

            "How could she accept that? She failed to protect him in an irreversible way and lead to her finally understood the truth. The safest place is by her side. At least, Rin would’ve learned what happened in person instead of vague recounts of the situation from Stanley afterward.\n",

            " \n",
            "The scary part was that Kara had directed the conversation completely naturally by asking a few questions. If it weren’t for looking at the situation from an outsider’s perspective and understanding her motives to shift the conversation, I wouldn’t even know that she’d done it.\n",
            " \n",
            "Rin was helpless in this situation and could only provide her sister with about vague details about how we met and interacted. She avoided mentioning her ability or time shenanigans and only gave a vague recollection of the situation.\n",
            " \n",
            "At this point, I’m relatively confident that Rin is not purposefully ignoring me and simply hasn’t noticed I’m standing next to her. That’s certainly good news.\n",

            "“We briefly chatted in Hard Difficulty.” Kara calmed down from the earlier surprise. “I never expected him to be married to you. It’s only been a year… He wouldn’t have cheated you into it?”\n",
            " \n",
            "“Do you think I’m that easy to take advantage of?” Rin rolled her eyes, before sitting down on a chair.\n",
